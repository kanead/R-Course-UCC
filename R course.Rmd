\section{Installation}
R is a computer language used to conduct statistics and data analysis
it can be downloaded here https://cran.r-project.org/ A nice interface for it can be downloaded here https://www.rstudio.com/

You can work directly within the console by typing code but it is better to write code
in a separate file called a script which can be saved, edited and run at a later date. 

R can be used for doing maths and it comes with a number of functions such as 'log10' preloaded 

```{r}
1+1
2*2 
16/4
5^2
log10(100)
```

To execute a line of code from your script you can highlight the whole line or simply 
click on the line and press 'ctrl R'

You can plot data as a scatterplot 
```{r}
x<- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y<- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 3, sd = 2)
plot(x,y)
```

or as histograms 



```{r}
hist(x)
hist(y)
```
